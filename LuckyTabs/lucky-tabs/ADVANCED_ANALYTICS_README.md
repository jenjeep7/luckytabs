# Advanced Pull Tab Analytics Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully implemented the advanced metrics suggested by ChatGPT for pull tab box analysis. These metrics provide comprehensive insights into the profitability, risk, and value of pull tab boxes.

## Implemented Metrics

### 1. **Core Metrics**
- **EV per Ticket**: Expected value per ticket (positive = profitable, negative = losing)
- **RTP Remaining**: Return to Player percentage (>100% = favorable to player)
- **Goodness Score**: Composite score from 0-100 ranking box attractiveness

### 2. **Buyout Analysis**
- **Cost to Clear**: Total cost to buy all remaining tickets
- **Net if Cleared**: Profit/loss if someone bought out the entire box

### 3. **Odds Analysis**
- **Top Prize Odds**: Probability of hitting top-tier prizes in next 1, 5, or 10 tickets
- **Profit Ticket Odds**: Probability of hitting profitable tickets (≥ ticket price) in next 1, 5, or 10 tickets

### 4. **Risk Analysis**
- **Risk per Ticket**: Standard deviation showing volatility/swinginess
- **Payout Concentration**: Percentage of total payout in top prizes (high = spiky)
- **Estimate Sensitivity**: Whether profitability estimates are sensitive to ticket count accuracy

## Key Formulas Implemented

### Expected Value per Ticket
```
EV = (Total Remaining Prize Value / Remaining Tickets) - Price per Ticket
```

### RTP Remaining
```
RTP = Total Remaining Prize Value / (Price per Ticket × Remaining Tickets)
```

### Hypergeometric Probability (for odds calculations)
Used to calculate the probability of hitting specific prize types in the next N tickets, accounting for drawing without replacement.

### Risk Calculation
```
Risk = √(E[X²] - μ²)
where μ = expected prize value per ticket
```

### Goodness Score
Weighted combination of:
- 50% EV per ticket (normalized)
- 20% Top prize odds (next 10)
- 20% Profit ticket odds (next 5)
- -5% Risk penalty
- 5% Stability bonus

## User Interface

### Accordion Display
The advanced metrics are displayed in an expandable accordion section that includes:

1. **Core Metrics Cards**: EV, RTP, and Goodness Score
2. **Buyout Analysis**: Cost and net profit for clearing the box
3. **Odds Analysis**: Color-coded chips showing probabilities
4. **Risk Analysis**: Volatility and concentration metrics
5. **Sensitivity Warning**: Alert when estimates are unreliable

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Positive/favorable metrics
- **Red**: Negative/unfavorable metrics
- **Blue**: Neutral information
- **Orange**: Warnings and sensitivity alerts

## Accuracy for Pull Tabs

These metrics are highly accurate indicators for pull tab analysis because:

1. **Hypergeometric Distribution**: Correctly models drawing without replacement
2. **Expected Value**: Fundamental measure of long-term profitability
3. **Risk Assessment**: Helps users understand variance and volatility
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Warns when ticket count estimates affect conclusions
5. **Concentration Metrics**: Identifies "lottery-style" vs "consistent winner" boxes

## Benefits for Users

- **Quick Decision Making**: Goodness score provides instant comparison
- **Risk Awareness**: Users understand volatility before purchasing
- **Buyout Strategy**: Clear metrics for bulk purchase decisions
- **Estimate Validation**: Sensitivity analysis helps refine ticket counts
- **Educational**: Users learn to evaluate boxes systematically

## Technical Implementation

- **Pure Functions**: All calculations are side-effect free and testable
- **Performance Optimized**: Calculations only run when needed
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Responsive UI**: Cards adapt to different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases (zero tickets, etc.)

This implementation transforms pull tab evaluation from guesswork into data-driven decision making, giving users professional-grade analytics for their gameplay strategy.
